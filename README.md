## Description

The BowlingFisica project is an attempt to simulate the real-world physics of bowling. The project focuses on the accurate reproduction of ball dynamics, pin collisions, and other physical phenomena that occur in a game of bowling. The project was developed in Unity3D as part of a high school physics assignment.
